* A reasonable .emacs.d

  Mainly for myself.
 
  - All packages are installed by el-get.
    - Package files are not included.
    - Instead of all packages used are indicated in "*conf.d/init-el-get.el*".
  - Configurations and initializations are all in *conf.d*.
  - Small functions defined by me are in *site-lisp*.
  - Temporary files are in *var*.
  
* If you will try this
  1. Clone this repository at ~/.emacs.d. 
  2. Open Emacs.
  3. Wait a moment. First setup procees takes a while.(and network required.)
  
  I use it with Emacs 24.3 on Windows 7 (Japanese IME patched http://sourceforge.jp/projects/gnupack/ ) and OSX
  (Japanese IME patched http://sakito.jp/emacs/emacs24.html#ime ).
